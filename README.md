Your task is to use RDD to estimate the effect of the following events in Quebec:

-- The 20/3/2020 lockdown
-- The reopening of schools on 31/8/2020
-- The 25/12/2020 lockdown
Requirements
You need to find data on at least one COVID measure for y (either COVID cases, hospitalizations or deaths) and provide the following for each:

A RDD plot similar to the ones shown above

An interpretation of the p-value on the effect of the measure taken (the cutoff parameter)

A justification on the design of your regression:

The amount of time included on both sides of the cutoff (longer is not necessarily better)
The polynomial degree (higher is not always better)
Other regression design considerations
A 2 paragraph explanation of your findings for that event.
