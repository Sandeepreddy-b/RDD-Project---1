The Task is to use RDD to estimate the effect of the following events in Quebec:

- The 20/3/2020 lockdown
- The reopening of schools on 31/8/2020
- The 25/12/2020 lockdown

Requirements
- Finding data on COVID cases (COVID measure for y) and provide the following for each:
- A RDD plot similar to the ones shown above
- An interpretation of the p-value on the effect of the measure taken (the cutoff parameter)

Justification on the design:
- The amount of time included on both sides of the cutoff (longer is not necessarily better)
- The polynomial degree 
- Other regression design considerations
- A 2 paragraph explanation of findings for the event.
